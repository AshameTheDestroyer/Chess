# Chess-Engine

Today we're not making any tedious Chess Game, no baby today we're making A WHOLE FUCKING CHESS ENGINE, and I'm serious about it, it will be my best project so far, and even for future projects it may top most of themâ€¦

### First Commit, Piece Movements:
1. Simple page navigation on the header.
2. Gameboard Page, where the board is presented to be played on.
3. Pieces can move via three main ways:
  * Via Mouse Clicking.
  * Via Keyboard.
  * Via Drag & Drop.
4. And some highlights for the following cell states:
  * Selected: which means the cell's selected via the keyboard.
  * Ready: which means the cell's piece's ready to be moved to another cell, if it exists.
  * Played-From: indicates the last played piece's previous cell.
  * Played-To: indicates the last played piece's new cell.
