# Chess-Engine

Today we're not making any tedious Chess Game, no baby today we're making A WHOLE FUCKING CHESS ENGINE, and I'm serious about it, it will be my best project so far, and even for future projects it may top most of themâ€¦

### First Commit, Piece Movements:
1. Simple page navigation on the header.
2. Gameboard Page, where the board is presented to be played on.
3. Pieces can move via three main ways:
   * Via Mouse Clicking.
   * Via Keyboard.
   * Via Drag & Drop.
4. And some highlights for the following cell states:
   * Selected: which means the cell's selected via the keyboard.
   * Ready: which means the cell's piece's ready to be moved to another cell, if it exists.
   * Played-From: indicates the last played piece's previous cell.
   * Played-To: indicates the last played piece's new cell.

### Context Menu:
1. As the name suggests, I've added a context menu, with dummy buttons for now, and it's built separately from the project, to work in every other project, and it contains the following features:
   * Groups: the ability to group certain buttons together to appear separately.
   * Tab Groups: the ability to hide certain groups in other tabs, to be accessible by tab buttons.
   * Selector Buttons: buttons that the context menu has to be clicked on an element that matches a certain CSS selector, for instance a Select Piece button can only appear when the context menu is clicked on a Piece element.
   * Conditioned Buttons: buttons that a certain condition must be met before the buttons appear.
2. Cell states are now grouped in an Enum in a better way for future development, with nice API to deal with.
3. Minor bug fixes.

### Home Page:
1. This one was simple, I created a basic homepage, with some Context Menu bug fixes, and then throwed a bunch of SASS on it.
2. I've made a Custom Button component, as well as a Custom Button Displayer, and I've given them a poppy cartoony-ish style, which in my opinion, looks amazing.
3. Custom Buttons implement:
   * Normal: boring.
   * Emphasized: which means the button will stand out with the primary colour of the page.
   * Arrowed: which gives the button a pointing arrow, either to left or right.
   * Iconified: which's the same as the aforementioned, but with a custom icon.
   * Linking: which allows the button to act as an anchor element.
 4. Custom Button Displayer is just a wrapper that allows for the following displays:
    * Flexified: displays buttons in Flex Mode.
    * Gridding: displays buttons in Grid Mode.
